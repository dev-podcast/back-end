Basho reports similar numbers this time around, except with a higher average deal size among its customer base. Average deal size is greater than $100,000, with high single-digit-customer deals exceeding $1m in total contract value. From 2014-2015, Basho reported a 50% increase in total contract value, a 45% increase in billings and a 50% increase in growth revenue.”</li>\n<li>Let’s do math...so...oh wait, left my Monte Carlo simulator in my other car.</li>\n<li>Products: “While both products share some underlying commonalities, they both address certain use cases. Riak KV is a key-value-based NoSQL database promoted generally to address use cases for content storing of session data, log file data, profile data and chat messaging data, particularly with gaming and gambling applications. Basho points out the product&#39;s resiliency and scaling capabilities, with integrations to Spark and Redis. Riak TS, on the other hand, is a database geared toward time-series data, with an emphasis on IoT use cases. Specifically, Riak TS can be used for gathering weather, seismic and traffic data, as well as for financial trading data. Time-series data has more structure, so Basho has added functionality to describe the data schema and the ability to query the data with SQL.”</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Coté was on Speaking in Tech</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/19/speaking_in_tech_episode_270/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Listen in</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>BONUS LINKS!
