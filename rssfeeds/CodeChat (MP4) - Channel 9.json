I've often found myself wanting to select a face in my design and do some fancy 2D graphics on that face, but the sketch environment in Fusion 360 is pretty basic. I finally figured out a good workflow for exporting a face from my 3D design, drawing in 2D on a replica of that face in my vector editor of choice, and then easily bringing my new drawing back in to Fusion 350... perhaps to initiate an extrusion. Hopefully this is helpful to you when making things.
