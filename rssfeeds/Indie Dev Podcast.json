Recently, Arc onyx made the transition to indie game development to pursue projects with philanthropic goals. When we started planning the game to create this year, we came across many wonderful organizations (like GameChangerCharity.org) that use games to help kids cope with the trauma and hardship that stems from having life-threatening illnesses. We are entirely focused on bringing uplifting gaming experiences to those who need it the most.\r\n\r\nWe discuss the animation industry, visually pleasing films from the 90s, and the success and failures of game studios over the last several years. We also dive into VR and talk about the potential future of that industry, and the feasibility of   unique experiences."],"guid":[{"_":"http://indiedevpodcast.podomatic.com/entry/2017-04-10T15_00_00-07_00","$":{"isPermaLink":"true"}}],"comments":["https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/indiedevpodcast/episodes/2017-04-10T15_00_00-07_00"],"pubDate":["Mon, 10 Apr 2017 22:00:00 +0000"],"dcterms:modified":["2017-04-10"],"dcterms:created":["2017-04-10"],"link":["https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/indiedevpodcast/episodes/2017-04-10T15_00_00-07_00"],"dc:creator":["Dave Voyles"],"itunes:keywords":[""],"enclosure":[{"$":{"url":"http://indiedevpodcast.podomatic.com/enclosure/2017-04-10T15_00_00-07_00.mp3","length":"48119077","type":"audio/mpeg"}}],"itunes:duration":["3006"],"itunes:image":[{"$":{"href":"http://assets.podomatic.net/ts/ba/0b/e9/startingline13/1400x1400_12079766.jpg"}}],"itunes:explicit":["no"],"itunes:summary":["Since 2007, Arc onyx provided animation and visual effects service to the TV and film industries.
