In quantum computing, we perform operations over qubits instead of bits. A qubit is a vector, which can take on many more values than 0 or 1.

It’s the fastest way to deploy an application on scalable infrastructure. I know this from experience, as I have built more software products on Heroku than I can remember. When a project I am building with Heroku starts to get more serious, I use Heroku Flow. Heroku Flow is a full continuous delivery solution for Heroku. With Heroku Flow, a push to GitHub spins up an instance of my application&#8211;called a &#8220;review app.&#8221; I can test the review app and discuss it with my team&#8211;and if it works, I can approve the changes and push it to master, where the new version of my app will run against continuous integration testing before being promoted to production. Heroku Flow brings the Heroku developer experience together with continuous delivery.

Diagnostic reports consolidate the information you need to reproduce errors in one place, including the stacktrace. Errors are grouped by root cause and mapped to users so you can easily identify which errors are the most widespread and affect the greatest amount of users. Integrate with Slack and PagerDuty to get notified in real-time of new errors and spikes in your error rate. Then, integrate with your issue tracker or use Bugsnag’s workflow to help you move errors through your debugging process and get them fixed for your users.  Airbnb, Lyft, and Shopify all use Bugsnag for error-monitoring.
