What was most difficult about exposing a Pythonic interface while maintaining the core principles of the original?</li>\n<li>Authentication and authorization are difficult problem domains and can cause significant issues if they are not implemented in a secure fashion. How do you ensure an appropriate level of quality in Yosai to be confident having people use it?</li>\n<li>To start can you describe how the framework is architected and what is involved in integrating it with a project?</li>\n<li>Outside of the context of web applications, what are some situations where someone should consider integrating authentication and authorization into their project?</li>\n<li>What have been some of the most challenging aspects of building the Yosai project?</li>\n<li>Tell us about the Rust extension you wrote earlier this year</li>\n<li>What do you have planned for the future of Yosai?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Keep In Touch</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://daringordon.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dowwie?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss\">GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/darin_gordon?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss\">@darin_gordon</a> on Twitter</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Picks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tobias\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.brainson.org/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss\">Brains On! podcast</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Darin\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/asphalt-framework/asphalt?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss\">The Asphalt Framework</a>.
