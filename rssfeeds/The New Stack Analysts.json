In our discussion at ServerlessConf Austin, we talked about both the tools used to secure serverless environments, and the methodologies used to provide inherent, consistently secure approaches. \n\nWe talked about how serverless moves the security concern from the infrastructure level to high-level targets, such as application security, data security, and network security. The panel agreed that there are many classic security questions which remain the same, especially in regards to best practices from cloud providers, but there are still new security threats dealing with the pace at which serverless allows teams to experiment. Finally, we also discussed how the state of serverless security will change as it sees greater adoption.\n\nWatch on YouTube:  https://youtu.be/QBKvDM_pgX4"],"itunes:subtitle":["In this episode of The New Stack Analysts, TNS Teâ€¦"],"description":["In this episode of The New Stack Analysts, TNS Technical Editor Ben Ball spoke to Mark Boyd, Writer and Analyst at Platformable, Guy Podjarny, CEO of Snyk, and Paul Johnston, Founder of Roundabout Labs, about the state of severless security.
