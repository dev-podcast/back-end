What does that extra work do for your career? We revisit this classic balancing act with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/normalfaults\">Nirmal Mehta</a> back at to DockerCon 2017. We start by asking about why he&#8217;s a Docker Captain, but his story is far more about being in operations and finding your Community. Nirmal&#8217;s story brings us back to the beginning of DevOps and through his journey of passionate hobbies that continue to help him grow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://geek-whisperers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1599\" src=\"http://geek-whisperers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http://geek-whisperers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta-300x300.jpg 300w, http://geek-whisperers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta-150x150.jpg 150w, http://geek-whisperers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Some specifics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difference of finding your tribe around D.C.
