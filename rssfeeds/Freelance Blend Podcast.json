That is exactly what happened to our latest guest. I am thrilled to share FBP 137 with all of you Freelance Blend listeners! In this episode, I interviewed growth hacker, digital marketing consultant, and fellow NBA fan, Nix Eñiego.</p>\n<p>Nix, Head of Marketing at Sprout Solutions, remembers his younger days of trading cards at Glorietta as one of the telling signs that his path was long laid out before him. Nix’s interest led him to start at an early age of 16 and by the time he was 18, he was already offering his own content and SEO service to international clients. Nix, now 25 years old, has been in the digital marketing industry for the last 8 years, learning digital marketing techniques and putting these into practice for Sprout, his own company, and his e-commerce websites.</p>\n<p>I have been in the freelancing industry for the last 3 years and have only met Nix in the last couple of months. Nix’s infectious enthusiasm will make you want to hang on his every word but if you’re like me, you’ll also wonder how is it that you’re only hearing from him now. Nix is now actively teaching new freelancers about digital marketing. When asked about why it took him all these years to reach out and teach a larger audience, Nix has got a very interesting story to tell.</p>\n<p>I promise you that this episode is packed with practical tips that you can immediately apply for your clients or your business.</p>\n<p>Listen to the podcast and get to know Nix’s journey!</p>\n<h3><strong>Key Highlights</strong></h3>\n<p>This episode is a gem! with Nix telling us of his experiences, sharing valuable tips, answering questions from Freelance Blenders.
